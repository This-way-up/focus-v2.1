<h1>Customization</h1>
<p class="lead">How to edit and customize your theme.</p>

<p>There are two ways to customize the theme. The easier method is using CSS, and the more advanced is customizing the SCSS files.</p>

<h2>CSS overrides</h2>
<p>Using the compiled files from the <strong>dist</strong> folder is the simplest way to get started with the theme.</p>

<p>Create a <code>custom.css</code> file in <strong>assets/css</strong> and reference it after the <code>theme.css</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your pages.</p>

{% highlight "html" %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/custom.css">
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then add your CSS rules in the <code>custom.css</code> file to override the theme styles.</p>

<h2>Customizing SCSS</h2>
<p>If youâ€™re comfortable using build tools and are familiar with SCSS syntax, this is the recommended option.</p>

<p>In the <strong>assets/scss</strong> folder, you'll see two files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>_user-vars.scss</code> for your custom variables.</li>
  <li><code>_user.scss</code> to add your styles.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you edit and compile these files, they will extend and override the theme's styles with your custom ones.</p>
